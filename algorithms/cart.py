        "Best" means that the average impurity of the two children, weighted by their
        population, is the smallest possible. Additionally it must be less than the
        impurity of the current node.

        To find the best split, we loop through all the features, and consider all the
        midpoints between adjacent training samples as possible thresholds. We compute
        the Gini impurity of the split generated by that particular feature/threshold
        pair, and return the pair with smallest impurity.

        Returns:
            best_idx: Index of the feature for best split, or None if no split is found.
            best_thr: Threshold to use for the split, or None if no split is found.
